Sometime later, Chester Bennington met Jeff Blue, vice president of Zomba Music; who told the young man about the auditions to be a member of the band, Linkin Park.</p>
                    <p>For the year 1999, he moved to Los Angeles, to try to enter Xero (Name of the band at that time). At his audition, Chester quickly attracted the attention of the band for his vocal quality, so he was accepted as a vocalist.</p>

                <article data-aos="fade-left">
                    <p>Michael Kenji Shinoda is an American singer, songwriter, rapper, multi-instrumentalist, record producer, and graphic designer. He co-founded Linkin Park in 1996 and is the band's lead vocalist, as well as rhythm guitarist, keyboardist, primary songwriter and producer. Shinoda later created a hip-hop-driven side project, Fort Minor, in 2004. He has also served as a producer for tracks and albums by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lupe_Fiasco" target="_blank">Lupe Fiasco</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Styles_of_Beyond" target="_blank">Styles of Beyond</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_X-Ecutioners" target="_blank">The X-Ecutioners</a>.</p>                    
                    <p>Shinoda is also the co-founder of Machine Shop Records, a California-based record label. Outside of music, Shinoda is an artist and graphic designer. He has painted several pieces of artwork, some of which have been featured in the Japanese American National Museum.On June 15, 2018, Shinoda released Post Traumatic, which contained 18 songs about his feelings following the death of colleague and longtime friend Chester Bennington, who died by suicide on July 20, 2017.</p>
                    <p>In 2004, Shinoda formed a side project called Fort Minor, which he used as an avenue to further showcase his hip-hop background. He explained the origin of the project's name in an interview stating, 'Fort' represents the more aggressive side of the music. 'Minor' can mean a few things: if you're talking about music theory, the minor key is darker. I wanted to name the album rather than having my name on the cover, because I want people to focus on the music, not me. Shinoda began recording songs for this side project following the release of Collision Course in November 2004.</p>

                    <p>Bradford Phillip Delson is an American musician and record producer, best known as the lead guitarist and one of the founding members of the American rock band Linkin Park.</p>
                    <p>Brad Delson attended Agoura High School in Agoura Hills, an affluent suburb of Los Angeles, with childhood friend and Linkin Park bandmate Mike Shinoda. He played in various bands throughout his high school career, the most notable being Relative Degree, in which he met and teamed up with drummer Rob Bourdon. Relative Degree's goal was simply to play a show and after achieving that goal, they disbanded.</p>
                    <p>In 1999, Delson's band, Xero, replaced former lead vocalist Mark Wakefield with Arizona native Chester Bennington and renamed themselves Hybrid Theory. Before long, Delson, along with Shinoda, had produced the six-track EP of the same name as the band, distributing it to various websites online and earning the band its own cult following. By 2000, after one more band name change, Linkin Park was signed by Warner Bros. Records. On October 24, 2000, Linkin Park released the overwhelmingly successful Hybrid Theory. Over the next year, Delson helped produce the remix album Reanimation (2002), and added his own creative insight into the remixed interpretation of "Pushing Me Away" ("P5hng Me A*wy").</p>
